You can find the latest version of our code in this repository

If you weren't interested in learning Git, here's my advice to stay updated:

Download the repository as a zip and unpack it. Leave the file structure intact.
You will only need to update the R scripts, unless I say otherwise.
Whenever you want to be sure you have the latest version of the scripts, go to this repository and check for new commits. Each commit has a message that briefly explains what was added. 
If you see a new commit, open the file that was changed on your computer.
Select all text in that file and delete it.
copy paste the updated script into that file and save it. 
DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE FILE. That might cause scripts to stop working if they refer to each other.
Congratulations, you have now updated your scripts! Did you know you can
use Git to update your files so you don't need to manually compare and copy-paste? It's never too late ;)
